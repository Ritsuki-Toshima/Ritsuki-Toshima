### Hi there 👋
Always enthusiastic, I’m also creative and love helping people by solving their problems.

I worked as an English teacher for three years, but I decided to make a career change to become a full-stack developer and joined in a coding bootcamp in Tokyo. Teaching had its rewards, but I realized that I could help more people by using the power of technology.

Now, my goal is to become a programmer who can write code that empathetically caters to each user's needs. I'm excited about the possibilities ahead and how technology can enable me to make a difference in people's lives on a larger scale.
